  Shopping List Detail
    ✓ should add an item to the list (1023ms)
    ✗ should check and uncheck an item (partially working - needs real-time sync)
    ✓ should check off an item when a WebSocket event is received (10ms)

  Tests:        3
  Passing:      2  
  Failing:      1 (TC-FE-5.5 - to be completed with real-time sync)
  Pending:      0
  Skipped:      0
  Duration:     6 seconds

Notes:
- TC-FE-5.4 is fully passing - items can be added to the shopping list
- TC-FE-5.5 has timing issues with optimistic updates, will be resolved with real-time sync in Task 2
- UI components (ShoppingListDetail, ShoppingListItem) are fully implemented
- State management hooks (useShoppingListDetails, useShoppingListItems, useAddShoppingListItem, useUpdateShoppingListItem) are working with mock data
